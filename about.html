                                <p>I have attempted to use Bootstrap 4 to create this website, along with a service called FontAwesome.</p>

                                <p>I had particular trouble with writing to/reading from the database through PHP from my home computer. It was only after I put my code on cmslamp that I realized it worked and it was just that I couldnt access the datase through code from my home computer, regardless of RASS ticket being open. I also had trouble with the mobile collapse menu when the screen size is less than 768pixels. I couldnt figure out why the Bootstrap wasn't working, but after some Googling, i found that the issue was I needed to makesure Bootstraps j-query script was called before the Bootstrap CSS script.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>I feel as though some of the PHP code is a little convaluted because it was written while still learning how to do certain things, and this may have lead to unneeded, messy code. I would also prefer not to use Bootstrap again as i found it quite annoying having to manually cancel what Bootstrap was doing, CSS wise, to be able to write my own CSS for a particular element.</p>
